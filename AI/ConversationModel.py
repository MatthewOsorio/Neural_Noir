                    He was murdered in his own home and the was beaten to death. There is no sign of forced entry so it was not a break in.

                    The morning after the incident was called in Mark was arrested at his home. He is the primary suspect of this case because he is the only man who matches the poor description provided by the neighbor.

                    collect enough evidence/statements to convict him of this crime.
