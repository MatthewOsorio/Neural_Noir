## Regarding Code Integrated from Other Sources
All code was developed by the team. Any similarities to online resources stem from implementation styles as suggested by the Panda3D Manual for Python, Version 1.10 (https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/index) and the OpenAI API documentation (https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

Note to the Teaching Team:

Due to commit misattribution during early development, I have manually counted the lines of code from my initial commits.
Total contribution = 724 (additions and deletions) + existing documented commits
